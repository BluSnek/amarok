TODO-list for amaroK
======================
<nick>  == reported by
-->nick == assigned to
#x      == sequential bug number,
           #83 being the highest available (take this one for your next bug and increase here)


SHORT-TERM (URGENT):

    * fix: #82 about dialog makes toolbar go crazy

MID-TERM:

    * fix: #79 GstEngine log volume -->markey

    * chg: #78 determine some behavior for the clear/shuffle/etc. buttons when a search is in action
               clear   -> only clear the stuff that was searched for?
               shuffle -> stop the search and do normal shuffle?
               additionally what to do when user rearranges a set of items that are the search result?
               <larson>No big deal to me as long as the behaviour is consistent. I.e. if shuffle shuffles
               the search, then clear should clear the search only, and visa versa.

    * fix: #76 <larson> Make playlist toolbar buttons toggle like the playerwidget buttons.

    * add: #75 Toolbar button in FileBrowser for switching recursive directory reading

    * fix: #73 <mxcl> can't resize newly displayed columns if they are hidden at beginning of session -->mxcl

    * fix: #72 <markey> get amaroK to play nice with valgrind

    * add: #39 <markey> add playlist column for media-type (mp3, ogg, mod, etc)
    * add: display type of media next to bitrate (<berkus> i moved it here, seems its the
           same as above, no?)

    * chg: instead of show file info why not use standard KDE properties? This has much more power
           than anything we could whip up and with taglib installed shows meta info and allows
           editing of it. <markey> this is already available in the FileBrowser: right-click -> "Properties"

    * add: tabbed playlists.
           Pro: it's convenient to have several playlists
           Contra: the playlist is getting cluttered enough as it is!

    * add: #32<markey> icecast metadata support (uses UDP channel) -->markey

    * add: #28<muesli> add an option "clean up playlist on startup"
              <mxcl> do you mean remove duplicates or dead entries etc. ? Cool.

    * add: <mxcl> option: don't crossfade for sequential tracks on same album. Comments? -->mxcl
           Of course, there would still be the up to 150ms gap, but we can fix that some other
           time.. <markey> please clarify: is this the same as BR #75388 ?

    * fix: add dirs to combo history when user adds a track from that dir to the playlist

    * fix: <mxcl>KListView sets the hand cursor on column(0) of the playlist. This is not
           relevant to amaroK since we are naughty and don't obey KDE's single click mode
           we should disable the hand cursor since that means "single-click to activate me"
           maybe override KListView::mouseMoveEvent, or is there a better way?
           <markey> I think the hand cursor looks appropriate here. FWIW, the hand is not only in
           column(0)

    * add: "show playlist" to the right click menu, redundant but necessary

    * add: <muesli> background chooser

    * add: more KTips, better KTips, somehow use the "Did you know" tip dialog (eg kmail, gideon, etc.) -->mxcl
           reduce arts buffer to ~20ms for much better analyzers etc.

    * add: extend documentation

    * add: history to add dialog, or implement better system for adding urls etc.

    * add: option to automatically adjust column widths

    * add: option to implicitly sort playlist by { track, album } (on drop only) -->mxcl

    * add: <muesli> reading metadata on the fly (read for displayed playlist-items or onClick)
           <berkus> this means that metadata is read only for visible now items or the items
           you click. (see winamp)

    * add: "add item"-dialog should support multiple selections

    * add: <berkus> playmode indication button in main widget (repeat track/pl/shuffle), clickable

    * add: function for adding all files in current dir to playlist.
           basically just a shortcut for going up to the parent directory, and then dragging
           the directory. imagine you're in the root directory of some filesystem, and want to add all
           files in it.. currently you'd have to select all files manually

    * add: seeking with mousewheel
           <muesli> what's seeking with mousewheel? <markey> dunno, but several users requested it
           <berkus> seeking the track via mousewheel, wheelUp to seek back, wheelDown to seek further

    * chg: #21<markey> use more accurate interpolation for analyzers (cubic or spline)

    * chg: can we make all buttons into actions? if we can, we could use setState(), a global
           actionCollection and save plenty of LOC. I see problems with the play/stop/etc
           buttons though.

    * chg: pre 1.0, big cleanup to reduce mem consumption (I dunno if we use a lot or not, but
           this is a good goal anyway!)

    * chg: pre 1.0, plan, cleanup and future-proof settings file keys. Will almost certainly
           mean that people will lose their settings, oh well, best to do it for the 1.0 release.

    * chg: select tracks on mouseup, not mousedown (does this make sense?)


LONG-TERM:

    * fix: #44 <markey> use kdWarning() instead of kdDebug() where appropriate

    * add: make windows magnetic / sticking together (difficult)

    * add: playlist export (generate text or html document from playlist entries)

    * add: make PlayerWidget shadeable (like XMMS)
           <mxcl> doesn't the systray provide this functionality already?
           <berkus> no it doesn't, double click the winamp/xmms window and see for yourself
           <larson> How do you propose this should work? Since we are handled by kwin and have
           normal window borders, double clicking the titlebar is handled by kwin. Also, should
           the playlist be shadable?

    * add: display some information about current track in playlist window

    * add: support for compressed archives / tarballs

    * add: <mxcl> implement beat detection (thread?), interface should glow/move to
           the beat, visualisations have access to beat/bpm info

    * add: audio system info widget, showing all available codecs and similar info

    * chg: resizable playerwidget, like in Winamp3.


IDEAS:

    * #12<markey> prevent zombie processes after amarok has exited (proper exit or crashing).
         such zombies can lead to very weird behaviour on next amarok start and eat ressources,
         and the user has no chance of noticing what's wrong.
         is it possible to catch crash signals and do some cleanup?
         <mxcl> I just read that KApplication tries to prevent zombies, so something is amiss
         <mxcl> perhaps KCrash can help us

    * bookmarks inside of tracks (good for very long tracks), and nifty bookmark browser

    * using filelight (as a kpart maybe) for a graphical representation of the playlist. so you could
      see at first glance how the altogether playing time is divided into different albums, tunes and
      so on.


DISCUSSING:

    * inf: <markey> I'd very much appreciate people keeping line length in all amaroK sources/textfiles
           at 110 characters max. Longer lines cause horrible dynamic line breaks or scrolling when you only
           have limited screen width, like in console or kdevelop. pretty please with icing =)
           <mxcl> I added a 110 char marker to my editor (since ages ago). However I don't always keep to it.
           Breaking lines is most often ugly :( Mostly I do though. You can praise me now ;)

DO-NOT-IMPLEMENT:

    * fix: #61 <markey> allow removing of playlist items by dragging back into browser.
               <larson> I think this is really weird. When I drag something I expect that someting to be
                added or opened in the target. Not removed from the sender.
                (RFC: is this still appropriate or would it be misleading?)
               <muesli> imho, it's misleading and not hid-compatible. i would rather
                expect that file to be copied to the browser's current
                directory.

    * add: a "hide playlist when main widget is not active" option (?? comments please: )
           <berkus> noo, we have it hiding into tray, thats enough (imagine how much flashing will be
           if i drag mouse around with "focus follows mouse" on - this is the one i use all the time)
           <mxcl> hence it's an option, you'd not use it with focus follows mouse. But it was just an idea
                  anyway.. dunno if I like the sound of it anymore either.
