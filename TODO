TODO-list for amaroK
======================


SHORT-TERM:

    * <berkus> in ui dialogs font labels need to resize vertically dynamically adopting the font size

    * fix: opening hidden directories is impossible in filebrowser

    * fix: shortcuts not saved (?)

    * fix: <berkus> make sure the expandbutton doesn't fire events when
      it has had its stack expanded (behaviour a-la Winamp Classic) (?)

    * fix: app freezing when renaming the file that's currently playing

    * fix: sample looping (annoying noise) @ end of track or pause

    * fix: redirected URLs do not work

    * add: extend keyboard shortcuts

    * add: extend documentation

    * add: show not only total track length but also remaining time in
      playerwidget


MID-TERM:

    * add: "add item"-dialog should support multiple selections

    * add: playmode indication button in main widget (repeat track/pl/shuffle), clickable

    * fix: honor KDE single/double-click setting in BrowserWin

    * add: display warning when artsd is run w/o realtime

    * add: background pseudo-transparency for playlist window

    * add: better cleanup at program exit; delete all new'ed objects

    * extend: ability to get currently playing title to clipboard, or writing
      info in some file or some other easy way to get this info..

    * add: function for adding all files in current dir to playlist

    * add: seeking with mousewheel

    * add: make windows magnetic / sticking together

    * add: make blinking currentTrack optional

    * add: display type of media next to bitrate

    * change: select tracks on mouseup, not mousedown


LONG-TERM:

    * add: title streaming (mp3PlayObject needs to be patched)

    * add: generate text or html document from playlist entries

    * fix: polish and finish i18n() stuff

    * add: adjustable gap between tracks, making recording easier

    * add: < berkus> add smooth fade outs on stop

    * add: make PlayerWidget shadeable (like XMMS)

    * display some information about current track in browserwin

    * support for compressed archives / tarballs

    * add visualisations

    * add bookmarks for filebrowser

    * add bookmarks (inside of tracks) and nifty bookmark browser

    * add pitch-slider (?) (berkus: should be in separate "Effects Control"
      panel)


IDEAS:
    * resizable playerwidget, like in Winamp3. Maybe using SVG graphics, or
      scaled down bitmaps. Would look most cool when it could resize smoothly
      in realtime *drool*
