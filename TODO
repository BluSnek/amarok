TODO-list for amaroK
======================
<nick>  == reported by
-->nick == assigned to


SHORT-TERM:

    * fix: when starting amarok from the console, I don't see the debug output any more
           (app is detaching from console)

    * fix: app freezing when trying to play remote file -->markey
    
    * fix: cannot enter remote directories in filebrowser any more
    
    * fix: select something in playlist, go to drag from the browser, move mouse over playlist,
           move mouse back to browser and drop, selected item from playlist disappears! I know
           what to do about this. <mxcl>

    * fix: <mxcl> reimplement ask recursively on drop operations to playlist

    * fix: <mxcl> GroupBoxes can't have check boxes with Qt 3.1, so before next release do
           some #ifdefs to surround that code and hope nobody gets too pissed about it

    * fix: playobject config GUI seems totally b0rked on 3.2

    * fix: writePathEntry is a KDE 3.1.3 function, which is perhaps too recent for the 0.7.1 release

    * fix: <mxcl> pause vis/anim timers when hide/show main widget as a courtesy to our users

    * fix: <mxcl> dialog boxes show behind the playlist (KDE 3.1), with no amarok.rc, playlist
            covers main widget on first start! <markey> that sometimes also happens with 3.2

    * fix: <muesli> clean up the GUI [mxcl wants to help, we should perhaps branch amaroK while we work]

    * fix: <grue> with focus-follows-mouse, both player window and playlist
           rise to foreground when you point on the player <mxcl> should now be fixed, please check

    * fix: <grue> when adding files from commandline they get sorted in reversed order

    * fix: <grue> ctrl-c for copying current title seems broken

    * fix: opening hidden directories is impossible in filebrowser

    * fix: app freezing when renaming the file that's currently playing

    * fix: redirected URLs do not work

    * add: history to add dialog, or implement better system for adding urls etc.

    * add: <mxcl> more KTips, better KTips, somehow use the "Did you know" tip dialog (eg kmail, gideon, etc.)

    * add: "show playlist" to the right click menu, redundant but necessary

    * add: <muesli> background chooser

    * add: <muesli> add OSD support (permanent display or just on events like a song switch)

    * add: extend keyboard shortcuts [<mxcl> show playlist, also I'd say do this with actions as it's easiest]

    * add: extend documentation

    * add: show not only total track length but also remaining time in playerwidget


MID-TERM:

    * fix: honor KDE single/double-click setting in BrowserWin
    
    * add: <muesli> reading metadata on the fly (read for displayed playlist-items or onClick)

    * add: "add item"-dialog should support multiple selections

    * add: <berkus> playmode indication button in main widget (repeat track/pl/shuffle), clickable

    * add: display warning when artsd is run w/o realtime

    * add: background pseudo-transparency for playlist window

    * add: better cleanup at program exit; delete all new'ed objects

    * add: function for adding all files in current dir to playlist

    * add: seeking with mousewheel

    * add: make blinking currentTrack optional

    * add: display type of media next to bitrate

    * add: save/load arts effects on close/startup automatically

    * chg: get rid of ugly noatun button-gfx (play, forward, etc.) and get some better ones 
        
    * chg: can we make all buttons into actions? if we can, we could use setState(), a global
           actionCollection and save plenty of LOC. I see problems with the play/stop/etc
           buttons though.

    * chg: pre 1.0, big cleanup to reduce mem consumption (I dunno if we use a lot or not, but
           this is a good goal anyway!)

    * chg: pre 1.0, plan, cleanup and future-proof settings file keys. Will almost certainly
           mean that people will lose their settings, oh well, best to do it for the 1.0 release.

    * chg: ability to get currently playing title to clipboard, or writing
           info in some file or some other easy way to get this info..

    * chg: select tracks on mouseup, not mousedown
                      

LONG-TERM:

    * add: make windows magnetic / sticking together (difficult)

    * add: generate text or html document from playlist entries
    
    * add: <berkus> add smooth fade outs on stop

    * add: make PlayerWidget shadeable (like XMMS) [<mxcl> doesn't the systray provide this functionality
           already?] [<berkus> no it doesn't, double click the winamp/xmms window and see for yourself]

    * add: display some information about current track in browserwin

    * add: support for compressed archives / tarballs

    * add visualisations

    * add: <mxcl> implement beat detection (thread?), interface should glow/move to
           the beat, visualisations have access to beat/bpm info

    * add: pitch-slider (?) [<berkus> should be in separate "Effects Control" panel]

    * add: aRts info widget, showing all available codecs and maybe more


IDEAS:

    * functionality for finding/browsing streams, smiliar to streamtuner
      (http://www.nongnu.org/streamtuner). possibly map this to the filebrowser

    * bookmarks inside of tracks (good for very long tracks), and nifty bookmark browser

    * resizable playerwidget, like in Winamp3. Maybe using SVG graphics, or
      scaled down bitmaps. Would look most cool when it could resize smoothly
      in realtime *drool*

    * think about moving amarok to kdeextragear

    * using filelight (as a kpart maybe) for a graphical representation of the playlist. so you could
      see at first glance how the altogether playing time is divided into different albums, tunes and
      so on.

DISCUSSING:

    * add: a "hide playlist when main widget is not active" option (?? comments please: )
           <berkus> noo, we have it hiding into tray, thats enough (imagine how much flashing will be
           if i drag mouse around with "focus follows mouse" on - this is the one i use all the time)

DUMPED:
