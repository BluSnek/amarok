TODO-list for amaroK
======================


SHORT-TERM:

    * fix: save stream names in playlist, not just IP address (using #EXTINF)

    * fix: show bitrate/frequency also for streams
    
    * fix: <muesli> clean up the GUI

    * add: <muesli> background chooser

    * add: <muesli> add OSD support (permanent display or just on events like a song switch)

    * fix: <grue> with focus-follows-mouse, both player window and playlist
      rise to foreground when you point on the player <mxcl> should now be fixed, please check

    * fix: <mxcl> session management (broke again!)

    * fix: <grue> when adding files from commandline they get sorted in reversed order

    * fix: <grue> ctrl-c for copying current title seems broken

    * fix: opening hidden directories is impossible in filebrowser

    * fix: <berkus> make sure the expandbutton doesn't fire events when
      it has had its stack expanded (behaviour a-la Winamp Classic) (?)

    * fix: app freezing when renaming the file that's currently playing

    * fix: sample looping (annoying noise) @ end of track or pause (fixed?)

    * fix: redirected URLs do not work

    * add: extend keyboard shortcuts

    * add: extend documentation

    * add: show not only total track length but also remaining time in
      playerwidget


MID-TERM:

    * change: can we make all buttons into actions? if we can, we could use setState(), a global
      actionCollection and save plenty of LOC. I see problems with the play/stop/etc buttons though.

    * change: pre 1.0, big cleanup to reduce mem consumption (I dunno if we use a lot or not, but
      this is a good goal anyway!)

    * change: pre 1.0, plan, cleanup and future-proof settings file keys. Will almost certainly
      mean that people will lose their settings, oh well, best to do it for the 1.0 release.

    * add: <muesli> reading metadata on the fly (read for displayed playlist-items or onClick)

    * add: "add item"-dialog should support multiple selections

    * add: playmode indication button in main widget (repeat track/pl/shuffle), clickable

    * fix: honor KDE single/double-click setting in BrowserWin

    * add: display warning when artsd is run w/o realtime

    * add: background pseudo-transparency for playlist window

    * add: better cleanup at program exit; delete all new'ed objects

    * extend: ability to get currently playing title to clipboard, or writing
      info in some file or some other easy way to get this info..

    * add: function for adding all files in current dir to playlist

    * add: seeking with mousewheel

    * add: make windows magnetic / sticking together (difficult)

    * add: make blinking currentTrack optional

    * add: display type of media next to bitrate

    * change: select tracks on mouseup, not mousedown

    * add: save/load arts effects on close/startup automatically


LONG-TERM:

    * add: generate text or html document from playlist entries

    * fix: polish and finish i18n() stuff

    * add: <berkus> add smooth fade outs on stop

    * add: make PlayerWidget shadeable (like XMMS) [<mxcl> doesn't the systray provide this functionality already?]

    * display some information about current track in browserwin

    * support for compressed archives / tarballs

    * add visualisations

    * <mxcl> implement beat detection (thread?), interface should glow/move to
      the beat, visualisations have access to beat/bpm info

    * add pitch-slider (?) (berkus: should be in separate "Effects Control" panel)

    * add: aRts info widget, showing all available codecs and maybe more


IDEAS:

    * functionality for finding/browsing streams, smiliar to streamtuner
      (http://www.nongnu.org/streamtuner). possibly map this to the filebrowser

    * bookmarks inside of tracks (good for very long tracks), and nifty bookmark browser

    * resizable playerwidget, like in Winamp3. Maybe using SVG graphics, or
      scaled down bitmaps. Would look most cool when it could resize smoothly
      in realtime *drool*

    * think about moving amarok to kdeextragear

    * using filelight (as a kpart maybe) for a graphical representation of the playlist. so you could
      see at first glance how the altogether playing time is divided into different albums, tunes and
      so on.
