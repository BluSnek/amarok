LONG-TERM:

    * add: < berkus> its a "drop-line" like in DeliPlayer - when you get a bunch of files (or a single file) and drag it around theres a single (red) line appears that shows position in which the file(s) will get dropped if you release your mouse

    * add: < berkus> add smooth fade outs on stop
