#x      == sequential bug number,
           #147 being the highest available (take this one for your next bug and increase here)


SHORT-TERM (URGENT):

  FIX 139 <markey> Find out why collection scan won't work with samba shares. Currently the scan just gets
                   stuck, hogging CPU and doing nothing useful.
  
  FIX 134 <markey> Ctrl-C as shortcut for copying title just doesn't work. We need to choose another
                   shortcut. How about a global shortcut?
  
  ADD 144 <mxcl>   Trying to play radio1's real audio stream with aRts engine caused amaroK to show an
                   error dialog that I could never read because X was completely frozen. Happened twice
                   and I had to reboot both times so I don't want to try it again unless I am the only
                   one it ever happens to! http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/realaudio/media/r1live.ram
                   
                   Ok, it happened again, seemingly for any stream, the error dialog was the cannot connect
                   to localhost title proxy one. I have no firewall on this machine at all so I am confused.
                   The URL I was trying was:
                   http://stream1.hia.no/ogg/dump/room1/ogg-theora-vorbis-high.2004-06-29-13:54:22.ogg
                   
                   X responds to no input, mouse nor keyboard. Haven't tried ssh yet as laptop is crap.
                   Will try..

MID-TERM:

  ADD 146 <markey> Option for automatic switching to ContextBrowser when you start playing a track.

  ADD 145 <markey> Function for removing dupes in playlist. Possibly with toolbar button and/or context item.

  ADD 143 <mxcl>   DCOP interface for ContextBrowser

  ADD 142 <markey> Add "custom" field for gst output sink properties in settings gui. See gstreamer-gconf
                   code in gst-plugins/gst-libs/gst/gconf.

  CHG 141 <markey> For critical errors, use warning dialogs instead of stderr output. (many distros build
                   with NDEBUG, and users are prone to missing debug messages).

  ADD 137 <markey> Ability to abort playlist reading. Can take very long when you drop a folder by accident.

  FIX 121 <markey> We should cut down on unnecessary/redundant debug output/warnings (noise).

  ADD 105 <markey> Make ArtsEngine depend not only on kdemultimedia-devel, but also on kdemultimedia,
                   since arts itself contains these crappy decoders and ppl come complain about bad sound.
                   Update: Would be even better to detect the mpeglib arts-plugins directly, since some
                   distros offer them as a separate package.

  FIX 131 <mxcl>   Grue reports with aRtsengine, amarok *, only loads 15-17 entries in dir with ~100,
                   media type is unimportant (happened for oggs, mp3s and flacs, mixed and otherwise)
                   Nobody else can replicate typically.

  ADD 127 <mxcl>   Connect PlayerWindow navigation buttons to KAction enabled states

  ADD 112 <markey> A facility to abort CollectionBrowser's scanning.

  ADD 104 <mxcl>   Perhaps a nice idea: when you drag playlistItems to a branch in the collection browser
                   it prompts to change the track's tags, so drag a track to the "moolaaa" album and that
                   track get's it's album tag changed to "moolaaa" and is inserted into the branch, so the user
                   know's what has happened.

  ADD 100 <mxcl>   We have several areas where we ask for paths, it would be good to make it so these
                   always reflect the most recent path the user has used, eg looking in /my/music/bands
                   in the FileBrowser means when you open the SearchBrowser this is the search path
                   would be easy with a KConfig XT key. May be nice to do this with the URL histories too.

  ADD  98 <mxcl>   Use the collection browser to add KCompletion to inline tag editing.

  ADD  96 <mxcl>   User asked for a CTRL-J itty-bitty dialog that allows you to jump to a specific part
                   of a track. I'll see if I can do it with tiny amount of code -->mxcl

  ADD  94 <markey> Progress display for playlist reading, in statusbar.

  FIX  87 <muesli> Don't rely on KDE timeouts to see whether a file is accessible or not,
                   since this really sucks for disconnected network shares. XMMS handles
                   this way better and it really is a problem in userland. maybe a thread
                   helps, which simply tries to fopen() the file. if this task hasn't been
                   finished in (let's say) 3 seconds, jump to the next song. XMMS even
                   remembers such files and their folders, so that it's not going to open
                   another file from that folder for the next few minutes. what about hdd
                   sleep-timeouts? opinions?

  CHG  78 <mxcl>   Determine some behavior for the clear/shuffle/etc. buttons when a search is in action
                   clear   -> only clear the stuff that was searched for?
                   shuffle -> stop the search and do normal shuffle?
                   ADDitionally what to do when user rearranges a set of items that are the search result?
          <larson> No big deal to me as long as the behaviour is consistent. I.e. if shuffle shuffles
                   the search, then clear should clear the search only, and visa versa.

  FIX  76 <larson> Make playlist toolbar buttons toggle like the playerwidget buttons.

  ADD  75          Toolbar button in FileBrowser for switching recursive directory reading.

  FIX  73 <mxcl>   Can't resize newly displayed columns if they are hidden at beginning of session -->mxcl

  ADD  39 <markey> Add playlist column for media-type (mp3, ogg, mod, etc).
                   Display type of media next to bitrate (<berkus> i moved it here, seems its the same as above, no?)

  ADD  28 <muesli> Add an option "clean up playlist on startup".
          <mxcl>   Do you mean remove duplicates or dead entries etc. ? Cool.

  ADD     <mxcl>   Option: don't crossfade for sequential tracks on same album. Comments? -->mxcl
                   Of course, there would still be the up to 150ms gap, but we can fix that some other time..
          <markey> Please clarify: is this the same as BR #75388 ?
          <mxcl>   No, this is just to make crossfading not ruin album transitions

  FIX              Add dirs to combo history when user adds a track from that dir to the playlist.

  ADD              "Show playlist" to the right click menu, redundant but necessary.

  ADD              More KTips, better KTips, somehow use the "Did you know" tip dialog (eg kmail, gideon, etc.) -->mxcl

  ADD              History to add dialog, or implement better system for adding urls etc.

  ADD              Option to automatically adjust column widths.

  ADD              Option to implicitly sort playlist by { track, album } (on drop only) -->mxcl

  ADD              "Add item"-dialog should support multiple selections.

  ADD     <berkus> Playmode indication button in main widget (repeat track/pl/shuffle), clickable.

  ADD              Function for adding all files in current dir to playlist.
                   basically just a shortcut for going up to the parent directory, and then dragging
                   the directory. imagine you're in the root directory of some filesystem, and want to add all
                   files in it.. currently you'd have to select all files manually.


LONG-TERM:

  ADD  93 <markey> New engine: using ALSA (maybe OSS, too) and XMMS plugins for decoding.

  ADD  32 <markey> Icecast metadata support (uses UDP channel) -->markey

  CHG  21 <markey> Use more accurate interpolation for analyzers (cubic or spline)

  ADD              Tabbed playlists.
                   Pro: it's convenient to have several playlists
                   Contra: the playlist is getting cluttered enough as it is!

  ADD              Seeking with mousewheel
          <muesli> What's seeking with mousewheel? <markey> dunno, but several users requested it
          <berkus> Seeking the track via mousewheel, wheelUp to seek back, wheelDown to seek further

  ADD              Make windows magnetic / sticking together (difficult).

  ADD              Playlist export (generate text or html document from playlist entries)

  ADD              Make PlayerWidget shadeable (like XMMS)
          <mxcl>   Doesn't the systray provide this functionality already?
          <berkus> No it doesn't, double click the winamp/xmms window and see for yourself
          <larson> How do you propose this should work? Since we are handled by kwin and have
                   normal window borders, double clicking the titlebar is handled by kwin. Also, should
                   the playlist be shadable?

  ADD              Support for compressed archives / tarballs

  ADD     <mxcl>   Implement beat detection (thread?), interface should glow/move to
                   the beat, visualisations have access to beat/bpm info.

  ADD              Audio system info widget, showing all available codecs and similar info.

  CHG              Resizable playerwidget, like in Winamp3.


IDEAS:

  ADD  12 <markey> Prevent zombie processes after amarok has exited (proper exit or crashing).
                   such zombies can lead to very weird behaviour on next amarok start and eat ressources,
                   and the user has no chance of noticing what's wrong.
                   Is it possible to catch crash signals and do some cleanup?
          <mxcl>   I just read that KApplication tries to prevent zombies, so something is amiss.
          <mxcl>   Perhaps KCrash can help us

  ADD              Bookmarks inside of tracks (good for very long tracks), and nifty bookmark browser

  ADD              Using filelight (as a kpart maybe) for a graphical representation of the playlist. so
                   you could see at first glance how the altogether playing time is divided into different
                   albums, tunes and so on.


DISCUSSING:

          <markey> I'd very much appreciate people keeping line length in all amaroK sources/textfiles
                   at 110 characters max. Longer lines cause horrible dynamic line breaks or scrolling when
                   you only have limited screen width, like in console or kdevelop. pretty please with icing =)
          <mxcl>   I added a 110 char marker to my editor (since ages ago). However I don't always keep to it.
                   Breaking lines is most often ugly :( Mostly I do though. You can praise me now ;)

DO-NOT-IMPLEMENT:

  FIX  61 <markey> Allow removing of playlist items by dragging back into browser.
          <larson> I think this is really weird. When I drag something I expect that someting to be
                   ADDed or opened in the target. Not removed from the sender.
                   (RFC: is this still appropriate or would it be misleading?)
          <muesli> imho, it's misleading and not hid-compatible. i would rather
                   expect that file to be copied to the browser's current directory.

  ADD              "Hide playlist when main widget is not active" option (?? comments please: )
          <berkus> Noo, we have it hiding into tray, thats enough (imagine how much flashing will be
                   if i drag mouse around with "focus follows mouse" on - this is the one i use all the time)
          <mxcl>   Hence it's an option, you'd not use it with focus follows mouse. But it was just an idea
                   anyway.. dunno if I like the sound of it anymore either.
