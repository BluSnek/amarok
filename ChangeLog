amaroK ChangeLog
================
(c) 2002-2004 the amaroK authors.


VERSION 0.9-beta2:
  * chg: some look-and-feel polishing in the main player window
  * add: option to turn off analyzers
  * add: splash-screen shown during program startup (optional)
  * fix: made stream playback with TitleProxy more stable (by using an unbuffered socket)
  * add: show stream metadata in on-screen-display
  * chg: transformed "EQ" button into a togglebutton, which can also hide the effect browser
  * add: new OpenGL analyzer, contributed by Enrico Ros <eros.kde@email.it>
  * fix: FreeBSD compile fixes, contributed by Markus Brueffer <brueffer@phoenix-systems.de>
  * fix: rewritten configure: checks properly for kdemultimedia presence,
         and adds --without-opengl and --without-gstreamer arguments

VERSION 0.9-beta1:
  * add: display warning when artsd is not running with realtime priority
  * add: Audioproperties are loaded as you scroll the playlist and get saved to playlist files
  * add: If trackname column is hidden, the title column will show the trackname until a title
         tag can replace it. If no title tag is found the trackname stays.
  * chg: Pressing "back" in Random Mode now works as expected and walks backwards
         through the list of recently played songs.
  * add: TitleProxy searches for a free local port (contributed by Stefan Gehn)
  * chg: Random Mode now stores the recently played songs in a buffer, which prevents
         playing the same songs too often.
  * add: "Play Next" context menu option
  * add: selected aRts-effects will be remembered on next program start, including settings
  * fix: sort numerical playlist columns in correct order
  * add: logarithmic fading algorithm makes crossfading smoother
  * add: Select a series of tracks, start inline tag-editing a tag and amaroK will prompt you to
         edit that tag for all tracks one-by-one. Also available: fill-down.
  * add: improved crossfading: will fade out smoothly when the stop button is pressed
  * fix: O(n) behavior for playlist scrolling fixed
  * add: setting to make playlist colours the KDE defaults
  * add: support for tag-editing directly in playlist
  * chg: replaced old FileBrowser with the comfortable fileselector from KDevelop
  * chg: analyzers now powered by a new, more flexible FFT routine
  * add: hide/show selected playlist columns
  * chg: upgrade streambrowser to kderadiostation 0.5
  * fix: many streams not loading from browser and AddItem dialog
  * chg: amaroK moved out of kdenonbeta. we are now member of KDE Extra Gear 1
  * add: on-screen-display (OSD), shows an overlay with information on the currently playing track
  * chg: use KMultiTabBar for browser selection
  * chg: migrated settings system to KConfig XT
  * add: playlist columns for length and bitrate
  * add: merged new audio engine in. this provides a generic interface class, with multiple
         backends. right now there is a backend for aRts and one for GStreamer (still rudimentary)

  * fix: crossfading aRts module. the fading is now much smoother than before
  * fix: crossfading bug. before the fix amaroK sometimes mixed up the two xfade sources,
         so it sort of faded in reverse (==crap)

         has a nice side effect of remembering the last played song, too. <berkus>
  * fix: write undo for Shuffle <berkus>
  * fix: the expandbutton doesn't fire events when it has had its stack expanded

         its quite easy to tweak the dynamics is needed.  is accessible the same as the other
         widgets, just click until it appears (though it looks the same as the original widget
         it just acts differently) - piggz (www.piggz.co.uk)
  * add: combo with history and completion for dir/file chooser
  * add: in configure.in.in for checking the version of TagLib, if compiled from CVS, if not,
         then show, that it uses bundled version of TagLib - Stormy
  * fix: font dialog sizing issues
  * add: resume playback option. Using this means your track starts up again where you left it
         last time you quit amaroK. Excellent feature for us developers :-)

  * fixed: compile error on GCC 3.3.1 in visQueue.cpp. bugfix by thiago
  * added: completely rewrote drag-and-drop code. works recursively now (optionally).
    plus dragging stuff from other applications into amaroK also works now.

VERSION 0.5.1:
  * added a Tip of the Day at startup to explain the user interface a bit
  * added restarting of artsd on first program start to make sure it registers
    the new mcopclasses
  * fixed possible compile error in viswidget.cpp
  * amaroK uses much less CPU now than it used to. This was mainly achieved by
    using a new FFT-analyzer module, which I took from Noatuns "Winskin"-plugin,
    and modified slightly to my needs. Also some other optimizations were made,
    which        improved the standby performance, when no song is playing. I'm still
    not satisfied with overall performance, tho, but it seems that most of the
    load is produced by the aRts code itself, so this will rather be difficult
    to improve.
  * fixed crash when "next" or "previous" was pressed without a track
    loaded
  * thanks to valgrind I was able to find and squish some serious bugs,
    most of which were related to pointers. to sum it up: pointers are evil.
    valgrind is great.
  * lots of UI-changes in the main widget. uses a background pixmap now, a
    custom font and widget for the time-display, and generally looks better
  * fixed issues with the liquid skin. unfortunately, there seems to be no way
    to display pushbuttons correctly with a black background under liquid. so,
    until I find a solution for that, the expandbutton widget doesn't look quite
    as cool as it used to. maybe I should ask mosfet about this..

VERSION 0.50:
  * renamed 0.15 to 0.50

VERSION 0.15:
  * playing streams now works! *yipeeee*
  * fixed tons of bugs in aRts playing code. i think i got it right now.
  * fixed loading and saving of playlists. can cope with all protocols now.
  * fixed a bug in EffectWidget.cpp, that gave a compile error on some systems.
  * Converting QString into std::string was not donecorrectly. Thanks to
    Whitehawk Stormchaser for that one :)
  * changed project name to "amaroK" and built new project-file

VERSION 0.14 (internal):
  * implemented use of arts-software-mixing, in case hardware-mixing
    (/dev/mixer) doesn't work
  * fixed crash when play was pressed without selecting a file
  * changed the direction of the volume-slider. maximum is now at the top
  * added automatic saving of current playlist on exit
  * added previous/next track
  * added two radiobuttons in the playerwidget for toggling the
    playlist/equalizer on and off. admitted, the equalizer doesn't yet exist, so
    it's just a dummy button :P
  * added popup-menu for the playerwidget. opens on
    right mouse button. this menu finally replaces the ugly menubar.
  * added some icons (from noatun) for the player-buttons instead of text
  * added pause function
  * changed most names in the source to comply with the
    (unofficial?) KDE c++ coding standard (using the prefix "m_" for member
    attributes and so on). This was real slave-work :/
  * cleaned up code in several classes
  * fixed problem where subwidgets got keyboard focus and were drawn dark with
    the liquid style. switched off focus completely, since it's not needed for
    this type of application

VERSION 0.13 (internal):
  * added cute animated pushbuttons with sub-menus
  * added saving playlists
  * added dragging items inside of playlist widget
  * added forward declarations in header files to reduce compile time
  * added saving of browserwin/splitter size
  * rewrote track information widget. used a html table for the text. looks much
    nicer now :)
  * fixed sorting function
  * fixed jump widget. removed huge memory leaks in the widget
  * fixed flicker in analyzer widget
  * tons of bugfixes in playing code. partly rewritten. seems to be much more
    stable now

    mpg123, smpeg, alsaplayer, and finally aRts
