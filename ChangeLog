  * fixed: compile error on GCC 3.3.1 in visQueue.cpp. bugfix by thiago
  * added: completely rewrote drag-and-drop code. works recursively now (optionally).
    plus dragging stuff from other applications into amaroK also works now.
  
VERSION 0.5.1:
  * added a Tip of the Day at startup to explain the user interface a bit
  * added restarting of artsd on first program start to make sure it registers 
    the new mcopclasses  
  * fixed possible compile error in viswidget.cpp 
  * amaroK uses much less CPU now than it used to. This was mainly achieved by 
    using a new FFT-analyzer module, which I took from Noatuns "Winskin"-plugin,
    and modified slightly to my needs. Also some other optimizations were made, 
    which	improved the standby performance, when no song is playing. I'm still 
    not satisfied with overall performance, tho, but it seems that most of the 
    load is produced by the aRts code itself, so this will rather be difficult
    to improve.  
  * fixed crash when "next" or "previous" was pressed without a track 
    loaded
  * thanks to valgrind I was able to find and squish some serious bugs, 
    most of which were related to pointers. to sum it up: pointers are evil. 
    valgrind is great.
  * lots of UI-changes in the main widget. uses a background pixmap now, a 
    custom font and widget for the time-display, and generally looks better	
  * fixed issues with the liquid skin. unfortunately, there seems to be no way 
    to display pushbuttons correctly with a black background under liquid. so, 
    until I find a solution for that, the expandbutton widget doesn't look quite 
    as cool as it used to. maybe I should ask mosfet about this..

VERSION 0.50:
  * renamed 0.15 to 0.50

VERSION 0.15:
  * playing streams now works! *yipeeee*
  * fixed tons of bugs in aRts playing code. i think i got it right now.
  * fixed loading and saving of playlists. can cope with all protocols now.
  * fixed a bug in EffectWidget.cpp, that gave a compile error on some systems. 
  * Converting QString into std::string was not donecorrectly. Thanks to 
    Whitehawk Stormchaser for that one :)					
  * changed project name to "amaroK" and built new project-file 

VERSION 0.14 (internal):
  * implemented use of arts-software-mixing, in case hardware-mixing 
    (/dev/mixer) doesn't work
  * fixed crash when play was pressed without selecting a file
  * changed the direction of the volume-slider. maximum is now at the top
  * added automatic saving of current playlist on exit
  * added previous/next track 
  * added two radiobuttons in the playerwidget for toggling the 
    playlist/equalizer on and off. admitted, the equalizer doesn't yet exist, so 
    it's just a dummy button :P
  * added popup-menu for the playerwidget. opens on 
    right mouse button. this menu finally replaces the ugly menubar.
  * added some icons (from noatun) for the player-buttons instead of text
  * added pause function
  * changed most names in the source to comply with the 
    (unofficial?) KDE c++ coding standard (using the prefix "m_" for member 
    attributes and so on). This was real slave-work :/
  * cleaned up code in several classes
  * fixed problem where subwidgets got keyboard focus and were drawn dark with 
    the liquid style. switched off focus completely, since it's not needed for 
    this type of application

  * added saving playlists
  * added dragging items inside of playlist widget
