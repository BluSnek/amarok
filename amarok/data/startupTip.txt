Some short information about the user interface:

<p>
Use Drag-and-Drop to transfer files from the filebrowser to the playlist. To 
remove files, just drag them back from the playlist into the filebrowser. 
</p>
<p>
There are submenus under the buttons in the playlist window. Just keep the 
buttons pushed down to reveal more functions!
</p>
<p>
Click on the player window with the right mouse Button to display the options 
menu.

Have fun :)
