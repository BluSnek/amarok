amaroK README
=============

amaroK - a new media player for KDE

There are many media players around these days, true. What's missing from most
players is a user interface, that doesn't get in the way of the user. How many
buttons do you have to press for simply adding some new tracks to the
playlist? amaroK tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop
interface, that really makes playlist handling easy.


    - fresh playlist concept, very fast to use, with drag and drop

    - plays all formats supported by aRts, including mp3, ogg, audio CDs,
      streams

    - audio effects, like reverb and compressor

    - compatible with the .m3u and .pls formats for playlists

    - nice GUI, integrates into the KDE look, but with a unique touch
