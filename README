amaroK README
=============

amaroK - a new media player for KDE

There are many media players around these days, true. What's missing from most
players is a user interface, that doesn't get in the way of the user. How many
buttons do you have to press for simply adding some new tracks to the
playlist? amaroK tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and
drop interface, that really makes playlist handling easy.


    - fresh playlist concept, very fast to use, with drag and drop

    - plays all formats supported by aRts, including mp3, ogg, audio CDs,
      streams

    - audio effects, like reverb and compressor

    - compatible with the .m3u and .pls formats for playlists

    - nice GUI, integrates into the KDE look, but with a unique touch

IMPORTANT INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

In order to compile and install amaroK on your system, type the following in the
base directory of the amaroK distribution:


                % ./configure --prefix=`kde-config --prefix`
                % make
                % make install


Using enable-final will usually give a much faster compile, but it may cause
compile failure. See the file INSTALL for more information.


                % ./configure --enable-final --prefix=`kde-config --prefix`

MINI-FAQ
========

Q: Why can't amaroK play MP3s?
A: It can! Chances are you're using Fedora/RedHat linux, they don't ship with
   MP3 decoders by default (due to patenting issues). Solution:
   
       ALT-F2, gg:redhat mp3 decoder howto, ENTER

Q: Where is the Collection Browser?
A: You need to install sqlite, reconfigure and rebuild. Check your PKG_CONFIG_PATH
   is set correctly if there are problems detecting sqlite!
       
Q: The amaroK analyzers are really unresponsive!
A: You are probably using the aRts engine, either use the GST or NMM engines, or
   reduce the size of your aRts buffer in kcontrol, sound system. The lower the
   buffer the more responsive the visuals. Yes this is a bug! Please help us fix
   it!
   
Q: There are no visualizations in the visualizations dialog.
A: You probably don't have xmms-config installed, reconfigure and build after
   installing the appropriate xmms-devel package.
   
Q: I've found a bug / I've got a great idea for amaroK!
A: Please report it at http://bugs.kde.org.

Q: Can I improve amaroK's startup time?
A: The aRts engine is the slowest to load, using an alternative will help.
   Prelinking amaroK has spectacular results; however if you have binary openGL
   drivers (eg Nvidia drivers), you will need to compile amaroK --without-opengl
   in order to get the amarokapp binary to prelink (the amarok binary is not
   important here).
   
Q: Do you accept patches!
A: Happily! Your best course of action is to let us know what you plan to do before
   you do any work so we can discuss it, but don't fret we haven't turned down a
   patch yet! Discussion is mostly to help you patch the correct bits of amaroK.
   Then either submit a patch to the mailing list, or commit if you have cvs access.
   However, please let us know before you commit new features to cvs! If you have a bug
   fix then just go ahead, this is open source afterall :)
