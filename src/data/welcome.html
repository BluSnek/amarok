<h1>Welcome to amaroK!</h1>
<div>There are many media players around these days, this is true. But, what's missing from most players is an interface that doesn't get in the way of the user. How many buttons do you have to press when simply adding media to the playlist? amaroK tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop interface that makes playlist handling really easy.</div>

<h2>Customise your amaroK</h2>
<div>amaroK has two main modes of operation. It can look and act a little like XMMS and other Winamp clones <SCREENIE>, or it can have a single window with a statusbar to keep you up to date with ther track progress. The default amaroK appearance is the latter, if you would like to use ama-amp mode <A href="amarok://amaamp_mode">click here</A>, to switch back <A href="amarok://default_mode">click here</A>.</div>

<h2>Using amaroK</h2>
<div>amaroK is all about easy playlist building! This welcome text is embedded in a tab in the BrowserBar. Each tab in the bar is a route to your music and media! Open the browsers by clicking the tabs and then drag media from the listings to the playlist! The different browsers are as follows:

<ol>
<li><h3>File Browser</h3><P>The FileBrowser will be the most useful browser to people at first. Use it to navigate your filesystem to where you keep your music and then drag and drop to the playlist. Filtering by <EM>*.mp3 *.ogg</EM> may prove useful to you.</P></li>
<li><h3>Search Browser</h3><P>Some people have too much music to remember where it all is. The Search Browser makes it easy to find lost tracks. Specify a search term (eg. "Chem" to find all your <EM>Chemical Brothers</EM> music), specify a path to start the search in and click <STRONG>Search</STRONG>! You can even drag and drop the files to Konqueror afterwards if you want to move them all to a sensible location so you don't need to search again next time.</P></li>
<li><h3>Collection Browser</h3><P>This is amaroK's lightning-fast music database. Assemble the database and enjoy the benefits of fast, categorised music sorting.</P></li>
<li><h3>Stream Browser</h3><P>Internet radio is a fabulous way to find out about new music without upsetting the various record industries of the world. Fetch the streams from the online meta-server and drag and drop something to suit your tastes. You can even submit your own favorite radio stations to the server to increase the choice for everyone else!</P></li>
