/**
    AtomicString is a thin wrapper over QString that makes sure only one copy of any equivalent string is stored in memory at any one time.
    As a side benefit, comparing AtomicStrings is reduced to a pointer comparison.
    Constructing an AtomicString is slower than constructing a QString as a hash has to be generated to ensure uniqueness.
    According to benchmarks, Paul Hsieh's SuperFastHash (which is currently used) can hash 5 million 256 byte strings in 1.34s on a 1.62GHz Athlon XP.
    For other use, the overhead compared to a QString should be minimal.
