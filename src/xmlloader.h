/**
 * Used for loading XML of the format outputted by MetaBundle::save(),
 * back into MetaBundle form.
 * There are four ways of using it:
 * - the simplest is to use MetaBundleXmlLoader::loadBundles(), which just
 *   returns a BundleList of the loaded MetaBundles, to load all the bundles
 *   synchronously in a single shot
 * - you can create a MetaBundleXmlLoader object and ask it to load(), and
 *   connect to the newBundle() signal to receive the loaded bundles, to load
 *   the bundles synchronously, but one-by-one
 * - you can use MetaBundleXmlLoader::loadInThread(), and the loaded bundles
 *   will get posted as BundleLoadedEvents to the object you specify; this way
 *   you can load asynchronously
 * - or you can derive from MetaBundleXmlLoader, reimplement the relevant
 *   functions, and do whatever you want
