<div align="center"><b>Shouter</b></div>
<b>About:</b><br>
This script was written as a vehicle for learning python, I'm open to
suggestions, comments and anything not overly abusive. With disclaimer out of
the way, forward with the details: this script will start a small server from
within amaroK and serve music streams on a specified port. The stream is taken
from what is currently being listened to in amaroK. This does not extend to
other streams. No streams are served while amaroK is in an idle state. This has
been tested with a bevy of user agents.<br>
<br>
Server log messages are appended to
~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts-data/access.log Debugging output is put in
~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts-data/shouter.debug<br>
<br>
<b>Configuration:</b><br>
Service configuration is done via the configuartion menu in the amaroK script
manager. Streams can be added via the Add/Drop stream buttons at the bottom of
the window.<br>
<br>
Note that many of the options from previous versions have been removed from the
configuration dialog. The 1% of users who have a compelling reason to adjust
some of these system variables can accomplish this by editing their shouterrc
file.<br>
<br>
<b>Dependencies:</b><br>
python >= 2.3<br>
PyQt<br>
<br>
<b>Gotchas</b><br>
The script will fail to start if there it finds a shouterrc file from a previous
version.<br>
<br>
Complaints about non-repeating snapshotted playlists can be resolved by
enabling the repeat playlist option before hitting the 'Configure...' button.<br>
<br>
The port set in the configuration is more of a strong suggestion than a rule.
The stream server will bind to another port if the requested one is
unavailable.<br>
