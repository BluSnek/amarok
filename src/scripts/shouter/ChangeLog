Refactored everything:
    * multiple streams
    * prettier configuration window
    * snapshotted playlist streaming
    * junked some vestigial config options, relying on smart defaults
    * expanded the former set of idle modes into more general stream types
    * better support for oft obnoxious PROPFIND requests 
    * index.pls support for web browsers
    * live streams can be paused
    * traded in playlist management that was dependent on track change events
      for multiple models that can better handle idle periods
