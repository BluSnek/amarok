<b>About:</b><br>
Score2Rating is a script that converts the scores of your tracks in amaroK to ratings using some 
pretty accurate intervals. (In the future, the intervals might become changeable).
This is mostly usable to give you a starting point for using the new rating system in amaroK 1.4.

It is recommended that you <i>back up</i> your database (the statistics table at least) before
running this script. It should do no harm, but you can never be too safe...
