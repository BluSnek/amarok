<b>About:</b><br>
Score2Rating is a script that converts the scores of your tracks in Amarok to ratings using some 
pretty accurate intervals. (In the future, the intervals might become changeable).
This is mostly usable to give you a starting point for using the new rating system in Amarok 1.4.
Tracks that already have a rating will only be updated if the calculated rating is higher.
If you have kdialog installed, a nice progressbar will be displayed showing how the script progresses.
</p>
<p>
Note that tracks with the same score can get different ratings, this is because Amarok rounds the
score that is saved in the database.<br>
An example: <i>If the shown score is 95 (the limit between rating 4.5 and 5), the database can
contain anything from 94.500 to 95.499. If the "real" score is below 95 (94.500-94.999), the track
will get a rating of 4.5, if it's above 95 (95.000-95.499), the rating will be 5.</i><br>
This will happen around all the rating limits.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended that you <i>back up</i> your database (the statistics table at least) before
running this script. It should do no harm, but you can never be too safe...
</p>

<p>
<b>Usage:</b><br>
Just start it and then click configure, and it will do everything automagically!
It will tell you tell you (using a popup in the playlist window) when it's done.
