This script installs the current development version of amaroK (from SVN) on your computer.

There will be a later version (4.0 I think) written in ruby (maybe python) instead of bash, that version will probably be split into smaller parts 
to make the 
script able to update itself on each run. That's the main reason why I put it in the SVN repository (besides making others able to change it, that 
is...)

For now, use the stable version. It's available at http://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php/AmaroK-svn

=============
CAUTION NOTES for 3.0-beta1
-------------

USE THIS VERION WITH CAUTION, but please try it out and report any bugs to ajocke AT gmail DOT com.

* The use_sudo variable isn't used anymore, you should remove the config file (.amarok-svnrc) in the folder where you usually run the 
script. use_sudo has been replaced with how_root, because the script now also supports kdesu.

* The script now also removes unused files by comparing unsermake -n uninstall before and after the configuration and then runs the lines that only 
are in the older edition of the command. This isn't fool proof, and it's the only reason I'm keeping this version as a beta. The diff has a 
possibility to create harmful commands... In this beta version, there's a big dialog box which shows the commands that will be run, so you can 
check that there are no harmful commands before lettin g the script run them.
