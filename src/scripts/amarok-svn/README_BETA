CAUTION NOTES for 3.0-beta
----------------------------

USE THIS VERION WITH CAUTION, but please try it out and report any bugs to ajocke AT gmail DOT com.

* The use_sudo setting isn't used anymore, you should remove the config file (.amarok-svnrc) in the folder
where you usually run the script. use_sudo has been replaced with how_root, because the script now also supports kdesu.

* The script now also removes unused files by comparing unsermake -n uninstall before and after the configuration
and then runs the lines that only are in the older edition of the command. I guess this isn't entirely fool proof,
and that's the only reason I'm keeping this version as a beta.
The diff might have the possibility create harmful commands... (I don't know yet, I haven't tried it enough...)

In this beta version, however, there's a big dialog box which shows the commands that will be run, so you can
check that there are no harmful commands before letting the script run them.
(If you don't want to let the script run the commands, press Ctrl+C in the console window running the script.
Then notify me about it.)

If this shows to be harmful, I'll just change the script to run all of the old commands if the commands differ.
