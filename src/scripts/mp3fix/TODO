08:57 < sebr> markey: your script repaired my files, thanks! but, it doesn't work so well when
              fixing multiple files
08:57 < sebr> keeps poping up messages
08:57 < sebr> maybe make the statusbar write which one is being fixed
08:57 < eean> it doesn't use kdialog anymore
08:58 < sebr> yeah, poping long messag
08:58 < sebr> markey: won't fix a file with a $ sign in the filename
