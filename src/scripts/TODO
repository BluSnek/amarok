Transcoding:
	Method 1: popen mplayer + lame/oggenc
		Use mplayer to decode track chunks to a temp file. 
			strip headers
			partition into chunks
			decode as needed
		Use lame/oggenc to encode to memory
		Read encoded file and stream

	Method 2: pygst + pylame
		Use pygst to decode to ...?
		Use pylame to encode to ...?
		stream encoded data

	Method 3:


	problems:
		Decoding:
			can't decode an ogg fragment that has no headers.
			Does every chunk need headers?
