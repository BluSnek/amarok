Now that we have libPlasma copied into our source tree, here is a list of local changes (to aid upgrading in the future):

* Changed Plasma/Applet Plasma/DataEngine and Plasma/Containment to AmarokContext/* respectively.
  Patch: patches/plasma.servicetypes.diff

* Changed libplasma to fix containment positioning problem. Containments are shown in 2x2 grid now instead of in one row.
  Patch: patches/plasma.containment_layout.diff
