Stuff to do for the context view:
=================================

* Fix horizontal resizing problems

Theme:

 * SVGize the images
 * Make the theme colorable, basing on the color scheme

Wikipedia:

 * Figure out why wheel-scrolling doesn't work with WebView ( <-- won't work, use Plasma's WebView)
 * Understand how to set configuration data to a DataEngine via QML (language)
 * Implement basic navigation buttons (back, forward)
 * Eventually hide Wikipedia search bar (depending on the point above)
