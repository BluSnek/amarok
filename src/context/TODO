Stuff to do for the context view:
=================================

Theme:

 * Understand why the Amarok logo is so weird in the SVG (wrong width)
 * Fix recolrization (get rid of strokes)

Wikipedia:

 * Figure out why wheel-scrolling doesn't work with WebView ( <-- won't work, use Plasma's WebView)

 * Implement basic navigation buttons (back, forward)
 * Eventually hide Wikipedia search bar (depending on the point above)
