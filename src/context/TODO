Stuff to do for the context view:
=================================

Level 0 (must-have items):
--------------------------

This set of items must be implemented before any merge is done.

 + Lyrics
 - Wikipedia
    * Get the ability to set wikipedia's language
    * Add buttons for artist/album/song switch
    * Make icons for artist, album, song (for the switcher), 75% transparent
    * (eventually evaluate the fact of moving away from icons)
    * Open up links in an external browser

 - Labels
 - Current song info
 - Similar artists


Level 1 (must-release items):
----------------------------

These items are blockers for a release, but it's not a big deal if they get in
during the development.

 - Photos
 - Tabs
 - ...?

Level 2 (maybe items):
----------------------

This set would contain the applets which don't really work well and are
definitely marginal, which get in the main UI only if a good interaction
paradigm is found. Nice to have, but nobody will cry if they're missing.

 - Events
 - Videos
 - Visualization
 - ...?
