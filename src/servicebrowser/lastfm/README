This is the last.fm service.

It uses code from the official last.fm client, which is released under the GPL.

The official client code lives under three directories:
libUnicorn - most of the sources from src/libUnicorn in the official client.
core - selected code for radio and scrobbling from src in the official client.
simple - ScrobSub integration library (Windows only)

Currently the code is from client version 1.4.2.58240. Newer versions can be
downloaded from <http://last.fm/download/>. When making changes, please try to
limit the amount of changes to the official client code, we would like to keep
it in sync, as previously we didn't, and the old code got broken on the server
end.

LastFmSettings, Settings, MooseCommon and AudioController in this directory
are re-implementations of files from the official client, adapted to suit
Amarok.
