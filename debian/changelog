amarok (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release.

  * Include patch from CVS to make amaroK bind listening TCP connections to
    the local interface only. Related to Bug#297693, but not the same.

amarok (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release packaged (closes: #296139). Lots of improvements and
    new functionality, see the changelog or http://amarok.kde.org for details.
    Bugs reported in the Debian BTS fixed with in this version:

    + the search text input element is now cleared when the user writes
      something there. (Closes: #278359)

    + analyzers work with the XINE engine. (Closes: #287091)

  * amaroK's collection can be now stored in a MySQL database:

    + Build-Depend on libmysqlclient12-dev

    + Pass --enable-mysql to configure.

  * amaroK now includes a sidebar plugin for Konqueror:

    + debian/amarok.install:
      - add files for the konqueror sidebar.

    + debian/control:
      - added kdebase-dev as Build-Dependency.

    + debian/rules:
      - exclude konqsidebar_universalamarok.so from dh_shlibdeps, so that
        amarok doesn't end up depending on konqueror. (The plugin will be
        ignored in systems without konqueror installed.)

  * Other changes:

    + amaroK now ships several scripts to enhance it. These are written in
      Python and Ruby, so add those as suggested packages. Added note to
      README.Debian about this, too.

    + removed sqlite3_in_configure.in.patch, no longer necessary in 1.2.

    + added www-browser as an alternative for the konqueror suggests, since
      upstream fixed the code so that the configured browser is used.

    + renamed debian/README to debian/README.Debian, so that it gets
      installed. D'oh!

    + debian/control:
      - remove Build-Dependency on libkjsembed-dev, no longer needed.

    + debian/amarok.install: 
      - install amarok.profile.xml into /usr/share/apps/profiles.

amarok (1.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Upload to get rid of the dependency on libflac4, which is not longer in
    the archive (closes: #289344). Urgency set to high as other packages with
    RC bug fixes can't enter testing because of the libflac6 transition not
    being ready.

    + Relibtoolized the package, so that binaries won't link against not
      needed libraries. Introduced disable_no_undefined.patch, many thanks to
      Daniel Schepler for his insight with this (and for providing the patch).
      [This has reduced the number of NEEDED libraries from 45 to 18, libflac
      being among them.]

    + debian/control:
      - version Build-Dependency on libtunepimp2-dev to (>= 0.3.0-2.1).

  * Some new versions of libraries have become available in Debian since the
    last upload:

    + Taglib 1.3 is now in the archive:
      - removed debian/patches/taglib-1.2-suffices.patch.
      - update Build-Depends to libtag1-dev (>> 1.3.1).

    + SQLite 3 is now in the archive:
      - changed Build-Depends on libsqlite0-dev to libsqlite3-dev.
      - pass --without-included-sqlite to ./configure.
      - patch configure.in to check for sqlite3 (>= 3.0). Upstream forgot to
        update this check in the 1.1 series. [sqlite3_in_configure.in.patch]
  
  * New package relationships:

    + amarok now recommends kdemultimedia-kio-plugins, which is needed to play
      audio CDs.

    + amarok now suggests konqueror, since it's called in the MusicBrainz
      dialog and some other places. (Closes: #282523)

  * Created a README.Debian files with the following:

    + Explain why the amarokapp and amarok_xmmswrapper2 binaries are shipped
      in /usr/lib/amarok instead of /usr/bin, differing from upstream.

    + Describe a fix for the 'Socket-path is not a link or a directory' error.

    + Explicitly mention what is needed to play audio CDs in amarok.

  * Other changes:

    + Patched admin/configure.in.min to include AM_MAINTAINER_MODE. To make
      the .diff.gz stuff smaller, force automake-1.6 (which upstream uses) in
      admin/detect-autoconf.sh. [am_maintainer_mode.patch, automake-1.6.patch]

    + Prevent admin/cvs.sh from creating .gmo files at "make dist" time, since
      those can't be shipped in the .diff.gz. [gmo_files_at_build_time.patch]

    + debian/amarok.1:
      - correct "hyphen vs. minus sign" usage.

amarok (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release packaged. Most notably, fixes several GStreamer
    engine related bugs.

  * debian/control: add to amarok-gstreamer's description that is not possible
    to use artssink for output.

  * debian/rules:
    - call dh_install with --list-missing (DEB_DH_INSTALL_ARGS).

  * debian/patches/:
    - removed proper-otherlang-handbook-path.patch, issue fixed upstream.

 -- Adeodato Simó <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Sat, 09 Oct 2004 22:51:06 +0200

amarok (1.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the location of translated amaroK handbook: kde/HTML/$LANG/amarok, not
    kde/HTML/$LANG directly. [debian/patches/proper-otherlang-handbook-path.patch]

 -- Adeodato Simó <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Mon, 27 Sep 2004 14:02:30 +0200

amarok (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:

    - includes handbook in several languages (da, et, fr, it, pt, sv).

  * First upload to Debian (closes: #236696).

amarok (1.1-cvs-0+kalyxo1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. Thanks to Peter Rockai for his initial work.

  * Updated to amaroK 1.1 CVS (2004-09-24):
    - temporarily link statically against libsqlite, since sqlite >= 3.0.7 is
      required and is not available in Debian (requested in #272271).
    - added debian/patches/taglib-1.2-suffices.patch to lower the requirement
      from taglib 1.3 (requested in #273029) to 1.2, which is enough.
    - new package amarok-xine (yet another engine for amaroK, hurray!)
    - added the following Build-Dependencies:
      + libkjsembed-dev (amaroK is now JavaScript scriptable).
      + libtunepimp2-dev (MusicBrainz support).
      + libxine-dev (for the xine engine).
      + libtag1-dev (missing).

  * New package amarok-engines:
    - depends on all the available engine packages and will be installed by
      default unless the user specifies an specific engine.
    - all the amarok-* packages Provide: amarok-engine, and amarok now
      Depends: amarok-engines | amarok-engine.

  * Removed the amarok-xmms package:
    - its single binary amarok_xmmswrapper2 is now included in the main amarok
      package.
    - include some hackery to prevent amarok from depending on xmms (!).
      amaroK just does a no-op and issues a warning on stderr if xmms is not
      installed and user opens the visualizations menu, so this seems safe.
      A xmms-lib package (in which amarok could easily depend) is requested in
      #272913.

  * Install amarokapp and amarok_xmmswrapper2 in /usr/lib/amarok instead of
    /usr/bin:
    - needed for FHS/Debian Policy compliance.
    - added debian/patches/some-binaries-in-usr-lib.patch to fix locations in
      source (amarok/src/loader/loader.cpp, amarok/src/socketserver.cpp).

  * Added lintian overrides for an aRts module which must go in /usr/lib
    despite not being a shared library. noatun and some other arts-related
    packages have the same problem, if someone has a solution please share.

  * Made /usr/share/doc/amarok-* symlinks to /usr/share/doc/amarok.

  * Do not make amarok-arts depend on the meta-package "arts"; the
    dependencies given by ${shlib:Depends} do suffice.

  * debian/control: updated to Standars-Version 3.6.1.
