amarok (1.1-cvs-0+kalyxo1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. Thanks to Peter Rockai for his initial work.

  * Updated to amaroK 1.1 CVS (2004-09-24):
    - temporarily link statically against libsqlite, since sqlite >= 3.0.7 is
      required and is not available in Debian (requested in #272271).
    - added debian/patches/taglib-1.2-suffices.patch to lower the requirement
      from taglib 1.3 (requested in #273029) to 1.2, which is enough.
    - new package amarok-xine (yet another engine for amaroK, hurray!)
    - added the following Build-Dependencies:
      + libkjsembed-dev (amaroK is now JavaScript scriptable).
      + libtunepimp2-dev (MusicBrainz support).
      + libxine-dev (for the xine engine).
      + libtag1-dev (missing).

  * New package amarok-engines:
    - depends on all the available engine packages and will be installed by
      default unless the user specifies an specific engine.
    - all the amarok-* packages Provide: amarok-engine, and amarok now
      Depends: amarok-engines | amarok-engine.

  * Removed the amarok-xmms package:
    - its single binary amarok_xmmswrapper2 is now included in the main amarok
      package.
    - include some hackery to prevent amarok from depending on xmms (!).
      amaroK just does a no-op and issues a warning on stderr if xmms is not
      installed and user opens the visualizations menu, so this seems safe.
      A xmms-lib package (in which amarok could easily depend) is requested in
      #272913.

  * Install amarokapp and amarok_xmmswrapper2 in /usr/lib/amarok instead of
    /usr/bin:
    - needed for FHS/Debian Policy compliance.
    - added debian/patches/some-binaries-in-usr-lib.patch to fix locations in
      source (amarok/src/loader/loader.cpp, amarok/src/socketserver.cpp).

  * Added lintian overrides for an aRts module which must go in /usr/lib
    despite not being a shared library. noatun and some other arts-related
    packages have the same problem, if someone has a solution please share.

  * Made /usr/share/doc/amarok-* symlinks to /usr/share/doc/amarok.

  * Do not make amarok-arts depend on the meta-package "arts"; the
    dependencies given by ${shlib:Depends} do suffice.

  * debian/control: updated to Standars-Version 3.6.1.
