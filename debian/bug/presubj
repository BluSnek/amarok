About these amaroK packages
===========================

    You're using an experimental version of amaroK, which I packaged
    into deb for the sole benefit of users preferring not to compile
    themselves.

    This version is not in the Debian archive, so please do not report
    bugs to the Debian BTS. Instead, I kindly request that you directly
    submit your bugs for this version to the upstream Bugzilla:

	    http://bugs.kde.org

    Thanks.
