 Likeback - a simple, context-sensitive, integrated feedback system for KDE
============================================================================

This directory contains the server portion of the Likeback client-server system.

 Amarok specific information
=============================

The working instance of the Likeback server for Amarok lives on
likeback.kollide.net. Feel free to push your fixes here, but also remember to
update (or request an update of) the instance on Kollide. To do this, either
contact Teo Mrnjavac (teo@kde.org, Teo` on #amarok) or, if you're an Amarok
developer, request admin access to the Likeback instance from Paleo, the Kollide
sysadmin.
The only two files present in the working instance and missing from this
directory (for obvious reasons) are db.conf.php and a dummy index.html.
