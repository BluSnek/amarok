Bringing back the hilighting effect of the sidebar buttons for active/inactive states. The solution I used is a pixmap-based effect, which is not ideal since we could just change the SVG like we do with tinting, but it was nicer to implement and works.

Also the animation needs some more tweaking, but that'll come later.
