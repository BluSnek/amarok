The following checklist is supposed to help you make sure you don't forget anything important in a commit.

For every commit:
* Does it conform to Amarok's coding style?
* Is there a feature request, bug report or review request associated with it? (Please close them with the commit message.)
* Does it introduce new dependencies?
* Does it add new strings? Is Amarok in string freeze?
* Has it been added to the changelog?
* Does the diff contain only the changes you made and files you added/removed? Does it contain all of them?

Additionally for commits introducing new features:
* Does it fit Amarok's vision or at least not work against it?
* Who will maintain the code?
* Is Amarok in feature freeze?
* Do existing regression tests still pass?
* Are new tests needed?
* Has it been reviewed by a usability person?
* Does user documentation exist?
